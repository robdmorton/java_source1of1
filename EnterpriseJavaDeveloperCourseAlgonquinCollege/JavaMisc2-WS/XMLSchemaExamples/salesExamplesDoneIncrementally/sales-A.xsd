	<!-- This is the first pass at the XSD for a stripped down
	     sales.xml
	     We begin with a global element named sales.
	     We want it to be a global element since a global element
	     can be a root element in an instance document.
	-->


	<element name="sales" type="p:SalesType" />

	<!-- For each element we specify the type.
	     We use the types defined by XMLSchema (the schema for schemas).
	     Some simple types include: string, integer, dateTime.
	     We can also use a complexType.
	     This is most usually the type of the root element so we
	     begin with that type.
	     Above we see that the type for the element named sales is
	     p:SalesType.  We define that complexType below.
	-->


	<complexType name="SalesType">
		<sequence>
			<element name="customer" type="string"
				minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" />
		</sequence>
	</complexType>
	
	<!-- The complexType SalesType is a sequence of zero or more customer
	     elements.
	     In this first pass we simplify matters by stating that customer is
	     of type string.  
	     Therefore the XML document MUST only contain string
	     data in the element customer.
	     This is the restriction that forces us to build the XML document
	     incrementally.
