	TODO 11b. Create an XML document as follows:
	
	- The root element should be called "search"
	- The search element has one child element called "id"
	- The content of the id element should be "424242"	
	
	This XML document is the search query that will be sent
	by the client to the Web Service. It represents a query
	for all sales by a particular customer. The customer is
	identified by the value of the id element.
	
	See /Web/sales.xml to understand the data model that this
	search criteria is built from.
	
	Add the necessary elements below this comment (eg. start 
	on line 21).

<search>
	<id>424242</id>
</search>
